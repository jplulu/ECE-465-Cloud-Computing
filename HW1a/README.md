# HW1 - Parallelized Single-source Dijkstra's Algorithm

This program is a parallelized implementation of the single-source Dijkstra's algorithm using Java threads. The program takes an adjacency matrix represented graph and a source node as input and outputs the minimum distance from the source node to all other nodes within the graph.

## Usage
An input.txt file that contains an adjacency matrix graph must be present in ```HW1a/```. This file must specify the number of nodes, the source node, and the adjacency matrix itself in the format below:
```
<number of nodes> <source node>
0 0 1
1 0 2
0 1 0
```
