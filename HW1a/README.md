# HW1 - Parallelized Single-source Dijkstra's Algorithm

This program is a parallelized implementation of the single-source Dijkstra's algorithm using Java threads. The program takes an adjacency matrix represented graph and a source node as input and outputs the minimum distance from the source node to all other nodes within the graph.
